bioperl-db INSTALLATION

GET THE RIGHT BIOPERL

You need at least the latest bioperl release of the 1.2.x series
(currently no earlier than 1.2.1) for the whole functionality to
work. The previous stable branch 1.0.x or the development series 
1.1.1 will not suffice.

If you are using the 1.2.1 release of bioperl you need to apply 
a small patch that comes with bioperl-db, onto-term.patch. Change 
directory into the root of your Bioperl source tree, than issue the 
following command, replacing the path with what is appropriate for 
your download:

  >patch -p0 < /path/to/bioperl-db/onto-term.patch


INSTALL BIOSQL

The bioperl-db package is designed to work with the BioSQL database.
Install the BioSQL package by following the instructions in its
INSTALL file. You can obtain the BioSQL package at www.open-bio.org. 
BioSQL requires a relational database, either Mysql, Oracle, or 
Postgres.


MAKE

Download the bioperl-db archive, then extract its contents. Example:

  >gunzip bioperl-db-0.1.tar.gz
  >tar xvf bioperl-db-0.1.tar
  >cd bioperl-db

Copy or rename t/DBHarness.conf.example to t/DBHarness.biosql.conf and 
edit the file as needed. Then issue the following commands from within 
bioperl-db/:

  >perl Makefile.PL
  >make
  >make test
  >make install

The 'make install' step may require that you have root privileges.


LOAD THE NCBI TAXONOMY

It is advisable to pre-load the NCBI taxonomy database using the
load_taxonomy.pl script in the BioSQL package. Otherwise you may see 
errors from mis-parsed organisms when you attempt to load sequences.


LOAD SEQUENCE DATA

Most people will want to load sequence data into their BioSQL
databases. Use scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl in the bioperl-db
package to load sequences from sequence files. Do:

  >perldoc scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl

or

  >scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl --help

for more information.

This script has many options to flexibly deal with various update
scenarios. Do read the POD before running an update.

LOAD ONTOLOGIES

Use scripts/biosql/load_ontology.pl in the bioperl-db
package to load ontologies from flat files. Do:

  >perldoc scripts/biosql/load_ontology.pl

or

  >scripts/biosql/load_ontology.pl --help

for more information.

This script has many options to flexibly deal with various update
scenarios. Do read the POD before running an update. Also, some
ontologies maintain obsoleted terms, for instance the Gene
Ontology. Read the POD for possible options to deal with obsoleted
terms; this is relevant even when you load the ontology the first
time, as you may choose to keep obsoleted terms out of the database
from the start.
