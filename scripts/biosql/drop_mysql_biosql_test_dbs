=head1 NAME

drop_mysql_biosql_test_dbs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In shell command line,

    drop_mysql_biosql_test_dbs 


=head1 DESCRIPTION

THIS script is for bioperl-db developers to drop all test databases,
which may be generated during runing 'make test'.

NOTE: This script is only for mysql database, since within my knowledge on 
DBI, I do not know how to connect to Oracle host without specific database.
As well, I do not have Oracle installed. You are welcome to adapt it into
Oracle and other RDBMS! :-)
