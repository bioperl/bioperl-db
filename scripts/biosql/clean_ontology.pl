# This script will remove specific records in ontology table, as well as in 
# term, term_relationship, term_path, term_dbxref, term_synonym, which are 
# related to ontology table.

# Note from the "editor" (Hilmar): 99% of this should not be necessary with
# enabled foreign key constraints. If you want to delete an entire ontology,
# delete the record from the ontology table, and everything else should be
# taken care of by the database server. Likewise, to get rid of an ontology
# term, delete the record from the term table. Dependent records in other
# tables should be deleted for you automatically through cascading deletes
# on the foreign key constraints. (This is one reason why properly supported
# foreign key constraints are extremely useful, not fluff as MySql used to
# claim.)
