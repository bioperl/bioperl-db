Bio::EnsemblLite - Deprecated
		   


See TODO list for status of modules & project.

------------------------------------------------------------------
 Setup
------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need
1) a mysql db server 

2) an account on the server

3) 2 databases on the server
   - one for the basic sequence db ( I called mine seqdb )
   - one to be your ensembl-lite db ( I called mine ensdev )
  You can call them whatever you want, but you may need to
  tweak the test scripts a little if you do.

4) copy PWD.basic PWD
   edit it so that all the information is listed.
   The default db is what is listed in PWD, you will
   need to edit t/add_basic.t, t/remove_basic.t if your
   basicseqdb is not called seqdb.

5) do the following (substituting your db name where appropriate)

   % mysql seqdb < sql/basicseqdb-mysql.sql

8) write down any problems, complaints and send them to bioperl ;)
