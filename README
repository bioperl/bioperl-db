Bio::EnsemblLite - Deprecated


Hard and Fast install instructions.

1) a mysql db server 

2) an account on the server

Running 'make test' should now work. To set the options for the test suite, look
into t/DBTestHarness.pm and make a file called DBTestHarness.conf

3) Make a single SQL database. In general many biological 
   "databases" will go into a single SQL instance


4) do the following (substituting your db name where appropriate)

   % mysql -u someone sqldbname < sql/basicseqdb-mysql.sql

5) scripts/load_seqdatabase.pl should now work.

6) write down any problems, complaints and send them to bioperl ;)
