bioperl-db INSTALLATION

INSTALL THE RIGHT BIOPERL

You need at least Bioperl version 1.4* but 1.4 has a problem 
in the ontology IO code for parsing GO, version 1.5* is preferable. 
Versions earlier than 1.4 will not work. See http://bioperl.org
for instructions.


INSTALL BIOSQL

The bioperl-db package is designed to work with the BioSQL database.
Install the BioSQL package by following the instructions in its
INSTALL file. You can obtain the BioSQL package at www.open-bio.org. 
BioSQL requires a relational database, either Mysql, Oracle, or 
Postgres.


MAKE

Download the bioperl-db archive, then extract its contents. Example:

  >gunzip bioperl-db-<release-version>.tar.gz
  >tar xvf bioperl-db-<release-version>.tar
  >cd bioperl-db

where <release-version> is the current release. Note that at present
there is no versioned release and you will need to download bioperl-db
through CVS.

Otherwise, copy or rename t/DBHarness.conf.example to
t/DBHarness.biosql.conf and edit the file as needed. Then issue the
following commands from within bioperl-db/:

  >perl Makefile.PL
  >make

You can run regression tests and install bioperl-db using the
following commands:

  >make test  
  >make install

NOTE:  bioperl-db tests require that the BioSQL database in
DBHarness.biosql.conf does NOT have NCBI taxonomy loaded.  Also,
the 'make install' step may require that you have root privileges.


INSTALLING bioperl-db ON WINDOWS

The following page on the BioPerl website has up-to-date
instructions on how to install bioperl-db on Windows:

http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_Bioperl_on_Windows


LOAD THE NCBI TAXONOMY

You should pre-load the NCBI taxonomy database using the
scripts/load_ncbi_taxonomy.pl script in the BioSQL package. 
Otherwise you will see errors from mis-parsed organisms when you 
attempt to load sequences.


LOAD SEQUENCE DATA

Most people will want to load sequence data into their BioSQL
databases. Use scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl in the bioperl-db
package to load sequences from sequence files. Do:

  >perldoc scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl

or

  >scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl --help

for more information.

This script has many options to flexibly deal with various update
scenarios. Do read the POD before running an update.


LOAD ONTOLOGIES

Use scripts/biosql/load_ontology.pl in the bioperl-db
package to load ontologies from flat files. Do:

  >perldoc scripts/biosql/load_ontology.pl

or

  >scripts/biosql/load_ontology.pl --help

for more information.

This script has many options to flexibly deal with various update
scenarios. Do read the POD before running an update. Also, some
ontologies maintain obsoleted terms, for instance the Gene
Ontology. Read the POD for possible options to deal with obsoleted
terms; this is relevant even when you load the ontology the first
time, as you may choose to keep obsoleted terms out of the database
from the start.


FEEDBACK

Write down any problems or praise and send them to 
bioperl-l@bioperl.org  ;-)
