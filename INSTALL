Hard and Fast install instructions.

1) You need a supported database server. Currently supported are
MySQL, Oracle, and Postgres.

	a) MySQL: downloads and installation instructions are at
	http://www.mysql.com/. You must have at least version 3.23.52
	installed and InnoDB enabled (see the MySQL documentation for
	how to do this; it is _not_ enabled by default. You can check
	your .err log for your MySQL host - it will conclusively tell
	whether InnoDB is enabled or not).

	b) Postgres: see http://www.postgresql.org/

	c) Oracle: the current schema version may contain bits only
	supported under 9i, but you should get a working system under
	8i as well.

2) You need an account on the database server that lets you create
schemas. See the RDBMS's instructions or your DBA if you don't have
such privileges.

3) You need at least the latest bioperl release of the 1.2.x series
(currently no earlier than 1.2.1) for the whole functionality to
work. The previous stable branch 1.0.x or the development series 1.1.1
will _not_ suffice.

   3a) If you decide on the 1.2.1 release of bioperl (which is the
   best choice for everyone who wants to program against a stable
   API), you need to apply a small patch that comes with bioperl-db,
   onto-term.patch. Change directory into the root of your bioperl
   source tree, than issue the following command (replacing the path
   with what is appropriate for your download):

	$ patch -p0 < /path/to/bioperl-db/onto-term.patch

   Afterwards install bioperl.

4) Download biosql-schema from open-bio.org. Instantiate the schema
appropriate for your RDBMS. The Oracle version of the schema is in
sql/biosql-ora in the biosql-schema repository.

For testing purposes you do not need to instantiate the schema except
for Oracle. The tests will create it automatically and drop it at the
end of each test.

5) Do the following from this directory:

	$ cd t
	$ cp DBHarness.conf.example DBHarness.biosql.conf
	$ cp DBHarness.conf.example DBHarness.markerdb.conf

and edit both new files appropriately to reflect your setup.

After that running 'make test' should work fine.

6) For the real stuff you want to instantiate the schema. If you
haven't done this already, do it now. As an example, assuming MySQL
and you downloaded biosql-schema next to bioperl-db:

   % mysql -u someone -p -D sqldbname < ../biosql-schema/sql/biosqldb-mysql.sql

7) Use scripts/load_seqdatabase.pl to upload sequences from
flatfiles. See its POD (--help option) for the available options.

8) Write down any problems, complaints and send them to 
bioperl-l@bioperl.org  ;-)
