Bio::EnsemblLite::UpdateableDB 
 we write to the Ensembl structure with additional tables for 
 generic_features.  See sql/ensembl-lite-mysql-addon.sql

 Unfinished routines
   - _update_seqs
     tricker than I thought, but we rely on clone.version for version
     numbers of any of its related data.

   - get_PrimarySeq_stream 
    Simple to implement using existing structures - will just iterate
    through list of get_all_primary_ids, will need object reference 
    to the iterator though.

Bio::DB::BasicUpdateableDB
   - _update_seqs
     version code is handled through dna_description

   - get_PrimarySeq_stream 
     Same as Bio::EnsemblLite::UpdateableDB


Wrap these into CORBA objects after additions to biocorba.idl

sql/ensembl-lite-sybase.sql is not really ready as the schema has changed
slightly.  Need to wait on the EnsemblSqlPort to get the schema translator
finalized.
