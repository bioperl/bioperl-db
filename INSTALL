bioperl-db INSTALLATION


GET THE RIGHT BIOPERL

You need at least the latest bioperl release of the 1.2.x series
(currently no earlier than 1.2.1) for the whole functionality to
work. The previous stable branch 1.0.x or the development series 
1.1.1 will not suffice.

If you are using the 1.2.1 release of bioperl you need to apply 
a small patch that comes with bioperl-db, onto-term.patch. Change 
directory into the root of your Bioperl source tree, than issue the 
following command, replacing the path with what is appropriate for 
your download:

  >patch -p0 < /path/to/bioperl-db/onto-term.patch


INSTALL BIOSQL

The bioperl-db package is designed to work with the BioSQL database.
Install the BioSQL package first by following the instructions in 
its INSTALL file. You can obtain the BioSQL package at www.open-bio.org.


MAKE

Copy or rename t/DBHarness.conf.example to t/DBHarness.biosql.conf and 
edit the file as needed. Then issue the following commands from within 
bioperl-db/:

  >perl Makefile.PL
  >make
  >make test
  >make install

The 'make install' step may require that you have root privileges.


LOAD THE NCBI TAXONOMY

It is advisable to pre-load the NCBI taxonomy database using the
load_taxonomy.pl script in the BioSQL package. Otherwise you'll see 
errors from mis-parsed organisms. 


LOAD SEQUENCE DATA

Most people will want to load sequence data into their BioSQL
databases. Use scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl in the bioperl-db
package to load sequences from sequence files. Do:

  >perldoc scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl

or

  >scripts/biosql/load_seqdatabase.pl --help

for more information.


FEEDBACK

Write down any problems or praise and send them to 
bioperl-l@bioperl.org  ;-)
