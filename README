Bio::EnsemblLite - an ensembl lite implementation of an updateable
		   sequence database

Bio::DB::BasicUpdateableDB - a very basic structure for storing
		             sequences and their annotations.  This
			     currently only supports the MySQL language 
			     scheme.

See TODO list for status of modules & project.

 Setup
------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need
1) a mysql db server 

2) an account on the server

3) 2 databases on the server
   - one for the basic sequence db ( I called mine seqdb )
   - one to be your ensembl-lite db ( I called mine ensdev )
  You can call them whatever you want, but you may need to
  tweak the test scripts a little if you do.

4) copy PWD.basic PWD
   edit it so that all the information is listed.
   The default db is what is listed in PWD, you will
   need to edit t/add_basic.t, t/remove_basic.t if your
   basicseqdb is not called seqdb.

5) do the following (substituting your db name where appropriate)

   % mysql seqdb < sql/basicseqdb-mysql.sql
   % mysql ensdev < sql/ensembl-lite-mysql.sql
   % mysql ensdev < sql/ensembl-lite-mysql-addon.sql

6) make any changes to the t/add_basic, t/remove_basic files
   if you did not call your db seqdb.

7) try it out
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
  
   or individually test
   perl t/add_basic.t
   perl t/remove_basic.t
   perl t/add_ensembl.t
   perl t/remove_ensembl.t

8) write down any problems, complaints and send them to bioperl or me.
