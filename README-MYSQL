BioSQL  notes:

If you want InnoDB compiled in MySQL 3.23 you need to download either the latest stable MySQL 3 (3.23 currently) MAX version (MAX is the MySQL version that has InnoDB compiled), or the stable (though officially gamma) MySQL 4 version.

If you have installed MySQL 3.23 MAX in order to activate InnoDB in your server you need to uncomment InnoDB related lines in the my.cnf MySQL configuration file. 

By default there is no configuration file, so if you don't have one you need to copy one of the sample files in the supporting_files/ directory to /etc/. There is four my.cnf files called my-small.cnf, my-medium.cnf, my-large.cnf, my-huge.cnf corresponding to predefined defaults for small, medium and large databases respectively. Pick any of them (you can modify it later and copy it to /etc/

for example:
cp /usr/local/mysql/support-files/my-small.cf /etc/my.cnf

Then edit the /etc/my.cnf to uncomment lines referring to InnoDB, specifically the following lines

innodb_data_home_dir = /usr/local/mysql/var/
innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:10M:autoextend
innodb_log_group_home_dir = /usr/local/mysql/var/
innodb_log_arch_dir = /usr/local/mysql/var/
set-variable = innodb_buffer_pool_size=16M
set-variable = innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=2M
set-variable = innodb_log_file_size=5M
set-variable = innodb_log_buffer_size=8M
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
set-variable = innodb_lock_wait_timeout=50

Finally you need to make sure the innodb_data_home_dir exists and is owned by the mysql user, e.g.

mkdir /usr/local/mysql/var/
chown mysql /usr/local/mysql/var/

Finally start the mysql server as per normal:
safe_mysqld &

(or mysqld_safe & depending on version)
